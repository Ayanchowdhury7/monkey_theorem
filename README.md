# monkey_theorem
implement monkey theorem including lettrs, digits, and punctuation.\n
monkey theorem dictates if a monkey has a type writer, he will wrote exactly as Shakesphere's novel.
But after how many times he can do that.
let's see.
so what ice bear do:
first: unpack your whole string into a list.
second: let ice bear make a list by guess the same length of the string including space,digits and punctuations.
third : compare the two different list. it seems if we compare two different list they can't be written in a different order.
what i mean by different order.
i.e - list1 = [a, b]
      list2 = [b, a]
 list 1 != list 2
 it's necessary to make the same order, i.e list2 = [a, b]
 then we can say list1 == list2

 if you don't bother to read the whole code, then i want to let you know that , multiply the result with 100.

if i did something wrong let me know.
any help is welcome with respect and love.
peace out.
